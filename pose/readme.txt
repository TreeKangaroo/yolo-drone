detect.py:          Perform inference with donModel.plan with multiple files
detect2.py:         create pose class and perform inference with a single file
detect3.py:         perform inference with onnx model

pose_ros_onnx.py:   ros node for pose detection using onnx model
pose_ros_trt.py:    ros node for pose detection using trt model. It is faster than onnx model
